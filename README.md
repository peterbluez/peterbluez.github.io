## What is this?

Welcome to my page. I hope to post updates on my various projects here. Largely for my consumption and usage, but I do like to share! 

## Projects

### **3D Printing**

3/7/24 - Purchased a Camera for the Raspberry Pi that runs the printer. Need to design a case for to attach to the lack tables.

4/5/24 - I started working on converting a small decorative crate into a lantern

The print tool chain is -

Fusion360 (design) -> Prusa Slicer (design slicer) -> Octoprint (running on Raspberry 4b+) -> Print on Prusa i3 Mk3S

Recently purchased 4 of these. Developing using micropython.
