## What is this?

Welcome to my page. I hope to post updates on my various projects here. Largely for my consumption and usage, but I do like to share! 

## Projects

### **3D Printing**

Not all of my prints are from my own design, but I am always working to expand my library of creations. Currently no video, but I hope to change this very soon.

The print tool chain is -
Fusion360 (design) -> Prusa Slicer (design slicer) -> Octoprint (running on Raspberry 4b+) -> Print on Prusa i3 Mk3S

### **Raspberry Pi Pico** 

Recently purchased 4 of these. Developing using micropython.

### **Scripting**

I code exclusively in Python right now, using Anaconda to manage my environments and VSCode for IDE. Please look over this repo for various examples of my work here.

### **Data Vizualization**
